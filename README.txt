Accessibility
- websites are designed for everyone to use
- How I build this website with accessibility in mind:
* headings to organize structure of content
* descriptive alt text for images
* descriptive link names
* colours that provide adequate contrast
* accessible forms with labels
* keyboard accessibility
* semantic elements (improve SEO and screen reader comprehension)
